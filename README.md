# NS4Dynamics

Official code for the NS-4DPhysics model, introduced in the paper:

> **NS-4DPhysics: Neural-Symbolic VideoQA with Explicit 4D Scene Representation and Physical Reasoning**

This repository contains the implementation of the neural-symbolic model that performs question answering over dynamic scenes by integrating explicit 4D scene representations and physical priors.

## üîç Overview

NS-4DPhysics is designed to answer complex temporal and counterfactual questions about object dynamics in videos. The model leverages:
- A 3D neural mesh scene parser
- Differentiable physics simulation
- Symbolic program execution

## üß† Dataset

We use the [DynSuperCLEVR](https://github.com/XingruiWang/DynSuperCLEVR) dataset, which contains synthetic video questions focused on:
- Velocity, acceleration, and collisions
- Temporal prediction and counterfactual reasoning


## üîß Setup (coming soon)

Instructions for environment setup and training will be provided in the next update.
